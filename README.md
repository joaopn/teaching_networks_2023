# Description

[Joao Neto](http://joaopn.github.io), 2023.

Welcome to the online materials for Network Science of Online Interactions at the University of Konstanz.

The course introduces Network Science as a means to analyze social networks at scale. It focuses on both the fundamentals of network analysis, and its application to social media. It aims to offer tools to understand how internet communities operate, and how users in those communities organize and interact. The platform Reddit will be primarily used as case study to develop theoretical and practical understanding of network analysis of online behavior and interaction structures.

Course materials will be based primarily on the book [“A First Course in Network Science”](https://cambridgeuniversitypress.github.io/FirstCourseNetworkScience/) by Menczer et al. In parallel to that, we'll have shorter talks touching on important topics that are useful for project development. 

# Location

The course will be held online on Zoom every Wednesday and Friday at 13h30 (link will be added later). The first lecture will be held in person in **Room D351**. 

# Course grading

The course is graded based on the final research project. It is split as
- 50% from the presentation
- 50% from a written report
- 10% extra by developing the project on Github,  publishing a notebook that can generate the figures shown in the report.

Check the project guide document for more details.

# Deadlines

- Project registration: **11/Jun/23**
